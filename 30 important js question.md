I'd be happy to extract the 30 questions and answers from the transcript for you. Here they are:

1. Q: Is CSS rendered before or after the DOM is constructed in the critical rendering path?
   A: CSS is rendered before and it's synchronous. It all has to be interpreted before we start parsing and showing the DOM.

2. Q: HTML is rendered incrementally as it's being interpreted. Can we say the same about CSS?
   A: No, CSS is blocking, so it's all or nothing with CSS. This is because CSS is a global namespace, so browser developers decided to interpret all the CSS and calculate any possible rule pointing to a specific element before moving on with the HTML.

3. Q: Which one will be interpreted after the HTML is fully rendered: async or defer script?
   A: Defer. Async will be interpreted as soon as it's downloaded, while defer will be done after the DOMContentLoaded event.

4. Q: Given that the box-sizing property of an element is border-box, is the padding included in the width calculation?
   A: Yes, the padding would be included in the width calculation in the case of border-box.

5. Q: Tell me three ways I can optimize my CSS to make my web application faster.
   A: 1) Clean it up with the coverage tool from the browser to ensure you're only shipping styles that are used. 2) Compression and caching. 3) Critical CSS - extracting all the CSS needed for the first render and loading the rest of the CSS after the initial render.

6. Q: What will be the final color of the button? (Context: ID selector mentioned)
   A: It's likely green. The ID selector has the highest specificity, so it will probably be applied.

7. Q: What are the different ways to store data in the browser?
   A: We can use cookies, local storage, and session storage.

8. Q: What is one advantage and one disadvantage of using closures in JavaScript?
   A: Advantage: Simpler function signatures because we don't need to pass many things into a function, as it has access to the local and global scope. Disadvantage: It uses a lot of memory because enclosed variables can't be garbage collected when we stop using that function.

9. Q: A user presses the submit button too often, triggering too many calls to our backend. How can we fix it?
   A: We could use debounce or throttle. Both would work for a button submission.

10. Q: What is the order of execution? (Context: Async code execution)
    A: First the synchronous code executes, then we go to the microtask queue (Promise), then the event loop tick finishes, and in the next tick, we print the timeout.

11. Q: What is the time complexity of the following code? (Context: Array.sort() and reduce())
    A: The time complexity is O(n log n) because of the sorting function. The reduce has a complexity of O(n), but in Big O notation, we only include the dominant term.

12. Q: Why is 'person' also an 'employee' in the following TypeScript code?
    A: It probably works because TypeScript has structural typing. In TypeScript, if two things have the same properties, they're considered the same type.

13. Q: What do ES6 modules allow you to do that 'require' does not?
    A: ES6 modules give you static analysis. Your transpiler or module bundler knows more about your modules, so it can do things like tree shaking. With require, we don't know much about the modules until we execute require at runtime.

14. Q: Explain the 'this' keyword in JavaScript.
    A: 'this' usually refers to the global scope. In an event handler, it refers to the element that triggered the event. In a normal function, it depends on how it was called. In strict mode, it points to nothing. In a method on an object or class instance, it refers to the object. With bind or apply, it's whatever you bind it to. Arrow functions inherit 'this' from their surrounding scope.

15. Q: Describe all the steps in an event loop tick.
    A: We clean everything in the stack, running it all the way down. When there's no more synchronous code to execute, we check our microtask queue. We execute any microtasks (like resolved promises). Then we repaint the browser. Finally, we look at the macrotask queue for the next tick.

16. Q: What are the two rules of hooks in React?
    A: 1) Hooks should be at the top of the component. 2) You should only use hooks inside another hook or inside a React component.

17. Q: Tell me one thing you can do with class components that you cannot do with functional components.
    A: Class components allow us to hook into different lifecycle methods. For example, you can control if a component should re-render with shouldComponentUpdate, or add error boundaries. These can only be done with class components because they have access to lifecycle methods.

18. Q: Why can't we use async functions as inputs to the useEffect hook?
    A: The useEffect hook expects a function, and whatever that function returns, useEffect would run as a cleanup function when the component unmounts. The problem with an async function is that it returns a promise, and the useEffect API doesn't understand that promise as a function.

19. Q: What does concurrent React or synchronous React mean?
    A: Concurrent React is the new architecture style of React, stable with React 18. React internally has a priority queue and can pause and restart render processes. This allows low-priority renders (like fetching data) to be paused for higher-priority updates (like user interactions), making the interface more responsive.

20. Q: What is a fiber in React?
    A: In the new concurrent React architecture, a fiber is a unit of work that contains all the code of your component, including props, state, and current memory state. React creates a tree of these fibers, and when it re-renders, it goes through the tree to find the work it needs to do. This structure allows React to pause renders and switch to high-priority ones.

21. Q: Name different ways we can optimize the re-rendering process in React.
    A: 1) Avoiding re-renders using useMemo. 2) Using useMemo and useCallback to ensure expensive computations inside a component don't get recomputed unless their dependencies change.

22. Q: What is rehydration in React, specifically in the SSR world?
    A: In server-side rendering, we send pre-rendered HTML from the backend. This HTML isn't interactive until we attach the virtual DOM and event handlers. After receiving and rendering the HTML, we call the hydrateRoot method to generate the actual component tree and virtual DOM, attaching it to the existing HTML. This process is called rehydration.

23. Q: What are three ways sibling components can share state?
    A: 1) Lift the state to a common ancestor/parent. 2) Use React context and connect both components to that context. 3) Use a state management library like Redux or MobX to connect both components to the same state.

24. Q: Name three disadvantages of global state.
    A: 1) Overuse can trigger a lot of re-renders if many components subscribe to the same global state variable. 2) It adds a dependency, coupling your code and making it harder to move components around. 3) Testing becomes harder because you can't test components in isolation; you need to mock the global state.

25. Q: Can you tell me a disadvantage of using React context?
    A: You might have unnecessary re-renders if you abuse context. It can also lead to less maintainability as suddenly all components are connected to the context.

26. Q: Name five techniques that I can use to make a frontend application faster.
    A: 1) Adding a CDN to serve assets closer to the user. 2) Compression of assets. 3) Caching. 4) Bundle splitting for lazy loading. 5) Image optimization, including compression, caching, and using efficient formats like WebP.

27. Q: What is code splitting and how does it work?
    A: Code splitting is when you have a bundle but decide to load only part of it on demand (lazy loading). In modern JavaScript, tools like webpack can analyze your dependency tree and work out what code you need on each route. This allows you to split your bundle into chunks and load them as needed, rather than loading everything upfront.

28. Q: Which Web Core Vital would be most affected by slow renders?
    A: Interaction to Next Paint (INP) is probably the most affected by slow renders. It measures the time from a user interaction to when the UI is next painted.

29. Q: Name three advantages and three disadvantages of using SSR (server-side rendering).
    A: Advantages: 1) Better SEO as pre-rendered HTML is easier for search engine bots to interpret. 2) Better performance, especially for First Contentful Paint. 3) Improved user experience with faster initial load.
    Disadvantages: 1) Increased complexity in setup and maintenance. 2) Coupling between frontend and backend. 3) Framework lock-in, often requiring use of specific frameworks like Next.js.

30. Q: What are the top three challenges when building a micro-frontend architecture?
    A: 1) Maintaining visual consistency across different micro-frontends. 2) Complexity in setting up and coordinating between different parts. 3) Sharing state between micro-frontends, such as authentication state or user settings.
