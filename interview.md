 Interview Preparation Guide

## Preparation Strategy

- IMPORTANT QUESTIONS 
  
  1. **Tell me about yourself.**
     
     - Prepare a concise introduction covering your background, skills, and goals.
     
     - I’m Ahmed Maher, a software engineer with over three years of experience specializing in building responsive web apps and e-commerce platforms. My journey into tech began in 2021, transitioning from civil engineering to software development through The Odin Project and CS50. Since then, I’ve worked with startups and entrepreneurs to create impactful solutions using React, Vue, and Node.js.
       
       Currently, I’m exploring advanced web technologies, including 3D rendering with Three.js, as well as TypeScript and Supabase to create scalable, real-time applications. I’ve also participated in hackathons and handled freelancing projects like **Noor-Orsod**, where I developed features, handled maintenance, and managed deployments on Oracle Cloud. Beyond technical work, I’m passionate about solving problems creatively and focusing on user-centered design
  
  2- **Describe a challenging project you worked on.**
3. - Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
   - When developing my blogging platform **Blogy** using **Supabase**, I encountered a challenge: creating a blog post and associating multiple tags with it in a **single, atomic operation**. Supabase doesn’t support client-side transactions directly, so I had to implement **server-side transactions** using **PostgreSQL functions** to ensure data integrity.
     - **Situation:** The goal was to allow users to create blog posts and tag them efficiently while ensuring that if any step failed, the entire operation would be rolled back.
     - **Task:** My task was to design a solution that inserted a blog post and associated tags in one operation without compromising data consistency.
     - **Action:** I created a **PostgreSQL function** called `create_blog_with_tags`. This function accepts the blog details and an array of tag IDs as parameters. It inserts the blog post, retrieves its ID, and loops through the tag IDs to associate them with the post. This entire process runs inside a **transaction**, ensuring that if any part fails, the operation rolls back.

4. **How do you handle tight deadlines?**
   
   - I handle tight deadlines by staying organized, **prioritizing** tasks, and remaining **calm under pressure**. When faced with a time-sensitive project, I start by breaking **down the tasks into smaller**, manageable pieces and identifying which ones have the **highest impact or dependency on others**. This helps me **prioritize effectively**. I also make sure to communicate with my team or stakeholders early if adjustments are **needed to ensure we're aligned**.

5. **Have you worked in a team?**
   
   - Provide an example of collaboration and conflict resolution.
   - Yes, I’ve worked in both small and large teams. A great example is during the Noor-Orsod project. I collaborated closely with both backend and frontend developers to troubleshoot issues and ensure smooth integration with Firebase and Oracle Cloud. At one point, we faced a conflict regarding deployment timelines. I facilitated a quick meeting to align expectations, which resulted in splitting tasks and adjusting priorities. This ensured we met the client's timeline without sacrificing code quality. I value clear communication and flexibility in teamwork

6. **Why do you want to work for 0000?**
   
   - I’m particularly excited about the opportunity at 00 because of your focus on leveraging technology to optimize asset management. My technical background in full-stack development aligns perfectly with your mission, and I am eager to contribute to building scalable tools that enhance investor experiences. I also see this role as a great opportunity to apply both my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities to meaningful projects that have a direct impact on ****. I admire 0000’ emphasis on technology-first solutions and believe my skills and ambitions are a great fit

## Final Tips

1. Practice explaining these concepts out loud, as if you're describing them to an interviewer.
2. Be prepared to discuss real-world scenarios where these features and concepts would be beneficial.
3. If you've used any of these features or solved related problems in your projects, be ready to share your experiences and insights.

Given the limited time, prioritize the areas you feel less confident about. Don't try to memorize everything; focus on understanding the core concepts and their practical applications.

Lastly, get enough rest before your interview. A clear, well-rested mind will serve you better than last-minute cramming. Good luck with your interview! Rod
