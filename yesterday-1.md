**Assignment: Backend Development for Core Entities**  

**Objective:**  

Design a database schema for the core entities of our application—specifically focusing on (Product, Vendor, User and Cart). Additionally, provide a list of REST endpoints that would interact with these entities. We're interested in seeing your approach to schema design and how you structure your code within a NestJS application.  

Implementing additional modules or schemas beyond the core entities is encouraged and will give you an edge.  

**Task Overview:**

1. Design a Database Schema:  
    - Focus on the main entities: (Product, Vendor, User, Cart).  
    - Define the relationships between these entities.  
    - Use MongoDB as the database.  

2.  - Extra modules or schemas are welcome and will give you an edge.  

3. Create a NestJS Application:  
    - Set up a basic NestJS app.  
    - Implement the schemas/models for the core entities.  
    - You do not need to develop the full application flow or business logic.  

4. List REST Endpoints:  
    - Provide a list of RESTful API endpoints that would interact with these entities.  
    - Briefly describe the purpose of each endpoint.  

5. Propose an Authentication Solution (Optional):  
    - If time permits, outline an authentication strategy suitable for serving multiple applications and user types.  
    - You do not need to implement this—just provide your approach.  

Note: Feel free to complete as much of the task as possible within the deadline. We're more interested in seeing your approach and skills, even if the work is not fully complete. Focus on writing quality code that highlights your strengths and impresses us! Implementing extra modules will give you an edge.
