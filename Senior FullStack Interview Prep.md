## Patch  1
### **Redis Questions**

#### **1. What is Redis and what are its primary use cases?**  
**Answer:**  
Redis is an open-source, in-memory key-value data store known for its high performance and versatility. It supports various data structures and is often used as:  
- **Cache:** Store frequently accessed data.  
- **Session Store:** Manage user sessions.  
- **Message Broker:** Implement pub/sub or queues.  
- **Analytics:** Fast data aggregation and leaderboard maintenance.

---

#### **2. Explain Redis persistence options: RDB vs AOF**  
**Answer:**  
Redis provides two persistence options:  
- **RDB (Redis Database File):**  
  - Saves a snapshot of data at intervals.  
  - Fast recovery but may lose recent writes.  
  - Suitable for backups.  

- **AOF (Append-Only File):**  
  - Logs every write operation.  
  - Slower but ensures minimal data loss.  
  - Suitable for write-heavy use cases.

**Combined Usage:**  
Use **RDB for backups** and **AOF for durability**.

---

#### **3. How does Redis handle data eviction policies?**  
**Answer:**  
Redis uses eviction policies to manage memory when the max memory limit is reached. Policies include:  
- **noeviction:** Returns errors when memory is full.  
- **allkeys-lru:** Evicts least recently used (LRU) keys.  
- **volatile-lru:** Evicts LRU keys with expiration set.  
- **allkeys-random:** Evicts random keys.  
- **volatile-ttl:** Evicts keys with the shortest time-to-live (TTL).  

Eviction is configured via `maxmemory-policy` in the Redis config.

---

#### **4. What are Redis data types and when would you use each?**  
**Answer:**  

| **Data Type** | **Description**                      | **Use Case**                                    |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **String**    | Binary-safe value (e.g., string, int)| Caching user data or counters (`INCR`).        |
| **Hash**      | Key-value pair map                  | Storing user profiles.                         |
| **List**      | Ordered list of strings             | Queues or message processing.                  |
| **Set**       | Unique unordered collection         | Tags or unique IDs.                            |
| **Sorted Set**| Set with scores for ranking         | Leaderboards or priority queues.               |
| **Stream**    | Append-only log structure           | Event streaming.                               |
| **Bitmap**    | Bit-level operations on strings     | Tracking user activity (bit flags).            |
| **HyperLogLog**| Approximation for unique counts    | Counting unique visitors.                      |

---

#### **5. How would you implement session management using Redis?**  
**Answer:**  
Redis is commonly used to store session data due to its speed and TTL support.

**Steps:**  
1. **Store Session:**  
   Save session data as a Redis key-value pair where the session ID is the key.  
   ```javascript
   const sessionId = 'user123-session';
   redisClient.set(sessionId, JSON.stringify(userData), 'EX', 3600); // Expire in 1 hour
   ```

2. **Retrieve Session:**  
   Validate the session ID on each request.  
   ```javascript
   redisClient.get(sessionId, (err, data) => {
     if (data) {
       console.log(JSON.parse(data)); // Use session data
     } else {
       console.log('Session expired or invalid');
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Delete Session:**  
   Invalidate a session during logout.  
   ```javascript
   redisClient.del(sessionId);
   ```

### **SQL/PostgreSQL/MySQL Questions**

---

#### **1. Explain the difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN with examples**  
**Answer:**  

| **Join Type**         | **Description**                                           | **Example Output**                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **INNER JOIN**         | Matches rows in both tables based on a condition.         | Common rows only.                        |
| **LEFT JOIN**          | All rows from the left table, plus matched rows from the right. | NULL for unmatched rows in the right.   |
| **RIGHT JOIN**         | All rows from the right table, plus matched rows from the left. | NULL for unmatched rows in the left.    |
| **FULL OUTER JOIN**    | All rows from both tables, matched or not.                | NULL for unmatched rows on either side. |

**Example:**  
Consider `Users` and `Orders` tables.

**Tables:**  
`Users`  
| id | name   |  
|----|--------|  
| 1  | Alice  |  
| 2  | Bob    |  
| 3  | Carol  |  

`Orders`  
| id | user_id | product  |  
|----|---------|----------|  
| 1  | 1       | Laptop   |  
| 2  | 3       | Phone    |  

**SQL Queries:**  
- **INNER JOIN:** `SELECT * FROM Users u INNER JOIN Orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;`  
  **Output:** Alice, Laptop; Carol, Phone.  

- **LEFT JOIN:** `SELECT * FROM Users u LEFT JOIN Orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;`  
  **Output:** Alice, Laptop; Bob, NULL; Carol, Phone.  

- **RIGHT JOIN:** `SELECT * FROM Users u RIGHT JOIN Orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;`  
  **Output:** Alice, Laptop; Carol, Phone.  

- **FULL OUTER JOIN:** `SELECT * FROM Users u FULL OUTER JOIN Orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;`  
  **Output:** Alice, Laptop; Bob, NULL; Carol, Phone.

---

#### **2. How would you optimize a slow-performing SQL query?**  
**Answer:**  
- **Indexing:** Ensure columns in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY are indexed.  
- **Query Rewrite:** Avoid SELECT *; only fetch required columns.  
- **Analyze Execution Plan:** Use `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.  
- **Partitioning:** Split large tables to reduce scanning time.  
- **Caching:** Cache frequent queries.  
- **Avoid Complex Joins/Subqueries:** Use common table expressions (CTEs) if needed.  
- **Optimize Index Usage:** Consider covering indexes or composite indexes.  
- **Limit Rows:** Use `LIMIT` for paginated queries.  

---

#### **3. Explain the concept of database normalization and its forms**  
**Answer:**  
Normalization organizes data to reduce redundancy and improve consistency.

| **Form**          | **Rule**                                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1NF**           | Data is atomic (no repeating groups).                                    |
| **2NF**           | 1NF + no partial dependency on primary keys.                             |
| **3NF**           | 2NF + no transitive dependencies.                                        |
| **BCNF**          | Every determinant is a candidate key.                                    |

**Example:**  

| **Non-Normalized Table** |  
| product_id | product_name | supplier_id | supplier_name |  
|------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|  
| 1          | Laptop       | 100         | TechSupply    |  

**3NF Table:**  
- **Products:** `(product_id, product_name, supplier_id)`  
- **Suppliers:** `(supplier_id, supplier_name)`

---

#### **4. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses?**  
**Answer:**  

| **WHERE**                       | **HAVING**                          |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Filters rows before grouping.    | Filters groups after aggregation.   |
| Works on individual rows.        | Works on aggregate functions.       |

**Example:**  
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary > 5000         -- Filter individual rows
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;       -- Filter grouped results
```

---

#### **5. How do you handle deadlocks in a database system?**  
**Answer:**  
- **Detect Deadlocks:** Use database logs or monitoring tools.  
- **Prevent Deadlocks:**  
  - Use consistent locking order (e.g., Table A → Table B).  
  - Use shorter transactions to minimize contention.  
  - Use lower isolation levels if acceptable.  
- **Resolve Deadlocks:**  
  - Database automatically picks a victim transaction and rolls it back.  
  - Handle errors with retry logic in the application.  

**Example:**  

```plaintext
Process 1: Locks Table A → Waits for Table B  
Process 2: Locks Table B → Waits for Table A  

Solution: Ensure both processes lock tables in the same order.
```
---


A **deadlock** happens when two or more processes (or transactions) wait indefinitely for each other to release a resource, preventing further progress.

---

### **Simple Example of a Deadlock:**

#### Scenario:  
Two processes need to access **two shared tables** (Table A and Table B) to complete their tasks.

1. **Process 1**:
   - Locks **Table A**.
   - Tries to lock **Table B** (but it's already locked by Process 2).

2. **Process 2**:
   - Locks **Table B**.
   - Tries to lock **Table A** (but it's already locked by Process 1).

**Result:** Both processes are waiting for the other to release its lock. Neither can proceed, creating a deadlock.

---

### **Visual Representation:**

```plaintext
    Process 1                Process 2
    -----------              -----------
    Lock Table A             Lock Table B
    Wait for Table B   <-->  Wait for Table A
```

Both processes are stuck, forming a "circular wait."

---

### **How to Prevent Deadlocks:**
1. **Consistent Lock Order:** Always lock tables in the same order (e.g., Table A first, then Table B).
2. **Timeouts:** Set a timeout for locks so transactions don't wait forever.
3. **Smaller Transactions:** Keep transactions short to reduce the likelihood of conflicts.

---

### **Node.js Questions**

---

#### **1. Explain the Event Loop in Node.js**  
**Answer:**  
The **Event Loop** is a mechanism in Node.js that handles non-blocking I/O operations by offloading tasks to the operating system or worker threads and processing them asynchronously.  
- **Phases in the Event Loop:**  
  1. **Timers:** Executes `setTimeout` and `setInterval` callbacks.  
  2. **Pending Callbacks:** Handles I/O callbacks deferred from the previous loop.  
  3. **Idle/Prepare:** Internal phase used by Node.js.  
  4. **Poll:** Retrieves new I/O events and executes callbacks.  
  5. **Check:** Executes `setImmediate` callbacks.  
  6. **Close Callbacks:** Executes `close` event callbacks like `socket.on('close')`.

```plaintext
Timers → Pending Callbacks → Poll → Check → Close Callbacks
```

---

#### **2. How does Node.js handle child processes?**  
**Answer:**  
Node.js provides the `child_process` module to create and manage child processes. These processes run independently and can communicate with the parent process via messaging or streams.  

- **Key Methods:**
  - `spawn`: Starts a new process for streaming data.
  - `exec`: Executes a command and buffers the output.
  - `fork`: Spawns a child process for Node.js scripts, with IPC (Inter-Process Communication).

**Example: Fork a Child Process:**
```javascript
const { fork } = require('child_process');
const child = fork('./child.js');

// Communicate with child
child.send({ hello: 'world' });
child.on('message', (msg) => console.log('Message from child:', msg));
```

---

#### **3. What are Streams in Node.js and how do they work?**  
**Answer:**  
Streams are objects in Node.js for handling continuous data flows efficiently. They use an **event-driven** approach, allowing data to be processed in chunks instead of loading everything into memory.  

- **Types of Streams:**
  1. **Readable:** Read data (e.g., file streams, HTTP requests).
  2. **Writable:** Write data (e.g., HTTP responses, file writes).
  3. **Duplex:** Both readable and writable (e.g., sockets).
  4. **Transform:** A duplex stream that modifies data (e.g., compression).  

**Example: Readable Stream:**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const stream = fs.createReadStream('file.txt', { encoding: 'utf8' });
stream.on('data', chunk => console.log('Chunk:', chunk));
```

---

#### **4. Explain the difference between process.nextTick() and setImmediate()**  
**Answer:**  

| **`process.nextTick`**                   | **`setImmediate`**                 |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Executes callbacks **before** the Event Loop continues to the next phase. | Executes callbacks in the **Check phase** of the Event Loop. |
| Higher priority than `setImmediate`.     | Lower priority compared to `process.nextTick`. |
| Used for deferring execution of code during the current phase. | Used for executing code **after** I/O events are processed. |

**Example:**
```javascript
process.nextTick(() => console.log('Next Tick'));
setImmediate(() => console.log('Immediate'));

// Output: 
// Next Tick
// Immediate
```

---

#### **5. How does clustering work in Node.js?**  
**Answer:**  
Clustering allows Node.js to utilize multiple CPU cores by creating a master process that spawns worker processes to share the workload.

- **Cluster Module:**
  - The `cluster` module creates workers that handle incoming requests independently.
  - The master process listens for requests and distributes them to workers.

**Example:**
```javascript
const cluster = require('cluster');
const http = require('http');

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  // Fork workers
  const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) cluster.fork();
  
  cluster.on('exit', (worker) => console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`));
} else {
  http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end('Hello World!');
  }).listen(8000);
}
```

- **How it Works:**  
  - **Master Process:** Manages the lifecycle of workers.
  - **Worker Processes:** Handle client requests independently.  
  - Improves scalability by utilizing all CPU cores efficiently.

### **ReactJS Questions**

---

#### **1. Explain the Virtual DOM and its Benefits**  
**Answer:**  
The **Virtual DOM** is an in-memory representation of the real DOM. React updates the Virtual DOM first, then efficiently reconciles the changes with the actual DOM using a process called **diffing**.

**Benefits:**
- **Efficiency:** Minimizes direct DOM manipulation.
- **Performance:** Updates only the changed parts instead of re-rendering the whole DOM.
- **Cross-platform:** Works on browsers and other platforms like React Native.

---

#### **2. What are React Hooks? Explain `useCallback` and `useMemo`**  
**Answer:**  
React Hooks allow you to use state and lifecycle features in functional components.  

- **`useCallback`**: Memorizes a callback function to prevent unnecessary re-creations on re-renders.  
  ```javascript
  const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
    doSomething(dep);
  }, [dep]);
  ```

- **`useMemo`**: Memorizes the result of a computation to avoid expensive recalculations.  
  ```javascript
  const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(dep), [dep]);
  ```

**When to Use:**
- Use `useCallback` for functions passed as props to child components.
- Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations or derived values.

---

#### **3. How Does React Fiber Architecture Work?**  
**Answer:**  
React Fiber is the reimplementation of React’s reconciliation algorithm to improve rendering performance by breaking rendering work into **small units** that can be paused and resumed.

**Key Features:**
- **Time-slicing:** Prioritizes rendering based on urgency (e.g., animations over background tasks).
- **Concurrency:** Allows interruptible updates, enabling smooth UI interactions.
- **Phases:**
  1. **Render Phase:** Builds a "work-in-progress" tree (can be paused).
  2. **Commit Phase:** Applies changes to the DOM (synchronous).

---

#### **4. Explain the Concept of Lifting State Up in React**  
**Answer:**  
**Lifting state up** means moving shared state to the closest common ancestor of components that need it.

**Scenario:**  
Two sibling components need access to the same data. Instead of duplicating state, move it to their parent and pass it down as props.

**Example:**
```javascript
function Parent() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");

  return (
    <>
      <Input value={value} onChange={setValue} />
      <Display value={value} />
    </>
  );
}
```

---

#### **5. What are Higher Order Components (HOCs) and When Should You Use Them?**  
**Answer:**  
An **HOC** is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional functionality.  
**Example:**
```javascript
function withLogging(WrappedComponent) {
  return function EnhancedComponent(props) {
    useEffect(() => console.log('Component Rendered'));
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
  };
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Reusing logic across multiple components (e.g., authentication, logging).  
- Enhancing component functionality without modifying the original.  

**Note:** React now favors **hooks** over HOCs for code reuse.

### **Docker Questions**

---

#### **1. What is Docker Containerization and How is it Different from Virtualization?**  
**Answer:**  
**Docker Containerization**: It allows you to package an application and its dependencies into a standardized unit called a **container**. Containers share the host OS kernel but run isolated environments, making them lightweight and fast.

**Difference from Virtualization**:
- **Containers** share the same host OS kernel, and only the application and its dependencies are isolated.
- **Virtualization** uses a hypervisor to create separate virtual machines (VMs), each with its own OS, making it heavier and slower than containers.

**Diagram:**
```
               Virtualization
        -------------------------
        |  Virtual Machine 1     |
        |  OS, App, Dependencies |
        -------------------------
        |  Virtual Machine 2     |
        |  OS, App, Dependencies |
        -------------------------
                (Hypervisor)
```

```
               Docker Containers
        -------------------------
        |  Container 1           |
        |  App, Dependencies     |
        -------------------------
        |  Container 2           |
        |  App, Dependencies     |
        -------------------------
                (Host OS Kernel)
```

---

#### **2. Explain Docker Networking Concepts**  
**Answer:**  
Docker networking allows containers to communicate with each other and with external systems. Key concepts include:

- **Bridge Network**: Default network for containers on the same host, isolated from external networks.
- **Host Network**: Shares the host’s network stack. The container uses the host’s IP address.
- **None Network**: No networking. Useful for isolated containers.
- **Overlay Network**: Used in multi-host networking (e.g., with Docker Swarm), allowing containers on different hosts to communicate.

**Example:**
```bash
docker network create --driver bridge my-bridge-network
```

---

#### **3. How Do You Optimize Docker Image Size?**  
**Answer:**  
To optimize Docker image size:

1. **Use smaller base images** (e.g., Alpine Linux).
   - `FROM node:14-alpine` instead of `FROM node:14`.
2. **Minimize layers**: Combine commands like `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y <pkg>`.
3. **Remove unnecessary files**: Use `.dockerignore` to avoid including files like `node_modules` or `.git`.
4. **Clean up** after installations:
   ```Dockerfile
   RUN apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
   ```
5. **Use multi-stage builds**: Separate build and runtime dependencies to reduce image size.

---

#### **4. Explain Docker Volumes and Their Use Cases**  
**Answer:**  
**Docker Volumes** are persistent storage that can be shared between containers or between a container and the host. Unlike container filesystems, volumes are not deleted when a container is removed.

**Use Cases**:
- **Data persistence**: Store data outside of containers to persist after restarts.
- **Sharing data**: Share data between containers.
- **Database storage**: Use volumes to store databases that need persistence across container restarts.

**Example:**
```bash
docker volume create my-volume
docker run -v my-volume:/data my-image
```

---

#### **5. What is Docker Compose and When Would You Use It?**  
**Answer:**  
**Docker Compose** is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. Using a `docker-compose.yml` file, you can configure services, networks, and volumes in a single file and run them together with a single command.

**When to Use**:
- **Multi-container applications**: For applications with multiple services (e.g., web app, database, cache).
- **Development environments**: Quickly set up local environments for testing and development.

**Example `docker-compose.yml`:**
```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  web:
    image: my-web-app
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example

#### **1. Explain the Difference Between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS**  
**Answer:**  
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Provides virtualized hardware resources like servers, storage, and networking. You manage the OS and applications.
  - Example: **AWS EC2**, **Google Compute Engine**.
  
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Provides a platform for developing, running, and managing applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
  - Example: **Google App Engine**, **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**.

- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Provides fully managed software applications over the internet, where users don’t have to worry about infrastructure or platforms.
  - Example: **Google Workspace**, **Salesforce**.

**Diagram:**

```
                   IaaS             PaaS              SaaS
                 (VMs, Storage)   (App Platform)    (Full Apps)
                   /                   /                 /
        Example: AWS EC2     Example: Google App Engine    Example: Google Docs
```

#### **2. What Are Microservices and Their Advantages?**  
**Answer:**  
**Microservices** are an architectural style where an application is built as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service focuses on a single business functionality and communicates via APIs.

**Advantages**:
- **Scalability**: Individual services can be scaled independently.
- **Resilience**: Fault in one service doesn’t affect the entire system.
- **Flexibility**: Different technologies can be used for different services.
- **Faster development**: Teams can work on services independently.

**Diagram**:
```
      +-----------+      +-----------+      +-----------+
      | Service A |----->| Service B |----->| Service C |
      +-----------+      +-----------+      +-----------+
```

---

#### **3. How Do You Handle Service Discovery in a Cloud Environment?**  
**Answer:**  
**Service discovery** is the process of automatically detecting and locating services in a distributed system. In cloud environments, this is typically done using:

1. **DNS-based Discovery**: Services register their IP addresses with DNS, and clients query the DNS to find services.
2. **Service Registries**: Tools like **Consul**, **Eureka**, or **AWS Cloud Map** store the locations of available services, and clients can query the registry for service instances.
3. **Kubernetes**: Uses built-in service discovery features via **Kubernetes DNS** to locate services in a cluster.

---

#### **4. Explain Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling**  
**Answer:**  
- **Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out/In)**: Adding more instances of resources (e.g., additional servers, containers).
  - **Use case**: Web applications with high traffic that require distributing load.
  - **Example**: Adding more EC2 instances to handle more requests.

- **Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up/Down)**: Increasing the power (CPU, RAM, storage) of a single instance.
  - **Use case**: Database applications that need more power but don’t need additional instances.
  - **Example**: Upgrading the instance size in AWS EC2.

**Diagram:**

```
Horizontal Scaling:
        +---------+     +---------+
        | Server 1|     | Server 2|
        +---------+     +---------+
        | Server 3|     | Server 4|
        +---------+     +---------+

Vertical Scaling:
        +-----------------+
        | Server (Bigger) |
        +-----------------+
```

---

#### **5. What Is Container Orchestration?**  
**Answer:**  
**Container orchestration** refers to the management of containerized applications across multiple hosts, automating deployment, scaling, networking, and availability. Tools like **Kubernetes**, **Docker Swarm**, and **Apache Mesos** handle container lifecycle management, including:

- **Automating deployments**: Distributing containers across nodes.
- **Scaling applications**: Automatically adjusting the number of containers based on load.
- **Load balancing**: Distributing requests among containers.
- **Self-healing**: Automatically restarting failed containers.

**Example**:  
In **Kubernetes**, containers are grouped into **Pods**, and the system automatically schedules and manages the pods across a cluster.

#### **1. How Would You Implement Authentication in a MERN Stack Application?**  
**Answer:**  
In a **MERN stack** application, authentication can be implemented using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for stateless authentication.

- **Backend (Express)**:  
  - **User logs in**: Backend verifies credentials (e.g., via MongoDB) and generates a JWT.
  - **JWT sent to client**: After successful login, the JWT is sent to the frontend, typically stored in **localStorage** or **sessionStorage**.
  - **Protected routes**: The JWT is sent in the `Authorization` header for requests to protected routes, where it’s verified on the server.

- **Frontend (React)**:  
  - Store the JWT and use it in the request headers for API calls.
  - Use **React Context** or **Redux** to manage the user’s authentication state.

**Example Flow:**
```
1. User submits login form --> backend validates and issues JWT
2. Frontend stores JWT in localStorage
3. For subsequent requests, frontend sends JWT in Authorization header
4. Backend validates JWT on each request
```

---

#### **2. Explain the Concept of Server-side Rendering vs Client-side Rendering**  
**Answer:**  
- **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**:  
  - The HTML is generated on the server, and the client receives a fully rendered page.
  - SEO-friendly, faster initial load.
  - Example: **Next.js** provides SSR by default.
  - **Drawback**: The server is responsible for rendering each request, which can increase load.

- **Client-side Rendering (CSR)**:  
  - The server sends minimal HTML, and the client (browser) loads JavaScript to fetch and render the content.
  - Example: **React**, **Vue.js** use CSR by default.
  - **Drawback**: Slower initial load time, but the app becomes more interactive once fully loaded.

**Diagram:**

```
  SSR                                  CSR
+------------------+         +-------------------+
|  Server renders  |         |  Minimal HTML sent |
|  the full page   |         |  JavaScript runs   |
+------------------+         +-------------------+
       |                          |
       V                          V
   User sees fully-rendered    User sees skeleton, then data loads
   page faster.                 after JS loads.
```

---

#### **3. How Do You Handle State Management in a Large Application?**  
**Answer:**  
For **large applications**, managing state can become complex. The most common solutions are:

1. **React Context**: Good for smaller to medium-sized applications. It allows passing data between components without manually prop drilling.
   
2. **Redux**: Ideal for large-scale applications. It centralizes the state in a store, which makes state management more predictable and easier to debug, especially with **Redux Toolkit**.
   - Use **Redux Thunk** or **Redux Saga** for handling async operations.
   
3. **MobX**: An alternative to Redux that uses observables and provides a simpler, less boilerplate way to manage state.

4. **React Query / Apollo Client**: These are specialized for **data fetching** and cache management, making it easier to manage server-side state.

**Tip**: Use a combination of these depending on the complexity and size of the app.

---

#### **4. Explain CORS and How to Handle It**  
**Answer:**  
**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** is a mechanism that allows web browsers to make requests to servers in different domains than the one that served the web page. Without proper configuration, browsers will block requests due to **security concerns** (same-origin policy).

- **How to Handle CORS**:  
  - **Backend**: Add proper headers to the response:
    - For **Express**, use the **cors** package.
    ```js
    const cors = require('cors');
    app.use(cors({ origin: 'http://yourfrontend.com' }));
    ```

  - **Frontend**: Ensure the request is being made to the correct server with the right credentials or headers.

  - **Preflight Requests**: Browsers may send a **preflight** OPTIONS request to check if the server allows CORS. Ensure your server handles this as well.

**Diagram**:

```
+---------------------+     Preflight Request     +---------------------+
|   Browser (Client)  |  -----------------------> |   Server (Backend)  |
|  Sends request to   |                           |  Handles CORS policy|
|  different domain   |                           |    and responds     |
+---------------------+ <----------------------- |                     |
    (Cross-Origin)                                (Allow CORS)
```

#### **5. What Are Design Patterns and When Would You Use Them?**  
**Answer:**  
**Design patterns** are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. They provide templates to solve common issues in a consistent and efficient manner.

**Common Design Patterns**:
1. **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.  
   - Use Case: Database connections, logging systems.

2. **Factory Method**: Provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.  
   - Use Case: When the creation process is complex or you need different objects based on certain conditions.

3. **Observer**: Allows a subject to notify its observers about changes without knowing who or what those observers are.  
   - Use Case: Event handling in front-end frameworks like React.

4. **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable.  
   - Use Case: Sorting algorithms, payment methods in e-commerce.

5. **Decorator**: Adds functionality to an object dynamically.  
   - Use Case: Adding features to UI components without altering their structure.

**When to use**:  
Use design patterns when the problem is well-defined and the pattern helps in solving the problem in a scalable and maintainable way.

### **HTML/CSS/JS/TS (Mid-Advanced)**

---

#### **1. Explain the Box Model in CSS**  
**Answer:**  
The **CSS box model** defines how the elements on a webpage are structured and how their size is calculated. It consists of four parts:

1. **Content**: The actual content of the element (text, images, etc.).
2. **Padding**: Space between the content and the border. Padding is inside the box, and it increases the element's size.
3. **Border**: Surrounds the padding (if any) and content.
4. **Margin**: Space outside the border. It separates the element from others.

**Diagram**:
```
|------------ Margin ------------|
|  |-------- Border --------|     |
|  |  |------ Padding ------|     |
|  |  |  | Content Here  |     |
|  |  |                  |     |
|  |  |                  |     |
|  |  |                  |     |
|  |  |                  |     |
|  |----------------------|     |
|----------------------------|
```

---

#### **2. What Are Promises and Async/Await in JavaScript?**  
**Answer:**  
- **Promises**:  
  A Promise represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It can be in three states:
  - **Pending**: Operation not yet completed.
  - **Fulfilled**: Operation completed successfully.
  - **Rejected**: Operation failed.

  Example:
  ```js
  let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let success = true;
    if (success) resolve("Data fetched!");
    else reject("Error occurred.");
  });

  promise.then(result => console.log(result)).catch(err => console.log(err));
  ```

- **Async/Await**:  
  These are syntactic sugar over Promises for better readability.  
  - **async**: Declares a function that returns a Promise.
  - **await**: Pauses execution of the async function until the Promise is resolved.

  Example:
  ```js
  async function fetchData() {
    let result = await fetch('https://api.example.com');
    let data = await result.json();
    console.log(data);
  }
  ```

---

#### **3. How Does Prototypal Inheritance Work in JavaScript?**  
**Answer:**  
**Prototypal inheritance** allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. Every object in JavaScript has a hidden internal property called `[[Prototype]]` (often accessed via `__proto__`). When accessing a property or method, JavaScript first checks the object itself. If not found, it checks the object's prototype chain.

**Example:**
```js
// Parent object
const animal = {
  speak() {
    console.log("Animal speaks");
  }
};

// Child object inherits from parent
const dog = Object.create(animal);
dog.speak(); // Output: "Animal speaks"
```

In this example, the `dog` object doesn't have its own `speak` method, so it looks up the prototype chain to find it in the `animal` object.

---

#### **4. Explain TypeScript Generics and Their Use Cases**  
**Answer:**  
**Generics** in TypeScript allow you to write flexible, reusable functions and classes while maintaining type safety. They let you define a placeholder type that will be specified when the function or class is used.

**Example Use Case**:
```ts
function identity<T>(value: T): T {
  return value;
}

let numberIdentity = identity(42);  // Type inferred as number
let stringIdentity = identity("hello");  // Type inferred as string
```

**When to use**:  
Generics are useful when you need to create functions or classes that can handle multiple types but you want to retain type safety, such as in **collections**, **API responses**, or **utility functions**.

---

#### **5. What Are CSS Grid and Flexbox? When Would You Use Each?**  
**Answer:**  
- **CSS Grid**:  
  A 2D layout system that allows you to control both rows and columns, providing powerful control over complex layouts. It's ideal when you need to create complex, grid-based layouts.

  **Use case**:  
  When you need to create a layout with rows and columns (e.g., dashboards, product grids).

  **Example**:
  ```css
  .container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  }
  ```

- **CSS Flexbox**:  
  A 1D layout system that is best for arranging items in rows or columns. It’s great for aligning elements along a single axis (horizontal or vertical).

  **Use case**:  
  When you need a simple, responsive layout or to align items within a container (e.g., navigation bars, form controls).

  **Example**:
  ```css
  .container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
  }
  ```

**When to use**:
- **CSS Grid**: Complex layouts with multiple rows and columns.
- **Flexbox**: Simple linear layouts or alignment of items within a container.

**Diagram** (Grid vs Flex):
```
CSS Grid:      |   CSS Flex:
+-----+-----+  |   +-----+-----+
|     |     |  |   |     |     |
|     |     |  |   |     |     |
+-----+-----+  |   +-----+-----+
|     |     |  |   |     |     |
+-----+-----+  |   +-----+-----+
```

### **9. Thread Pool (Node.js Specific)**

---

#### **1. What is the Thread Pool in Node.js?**
**Answer:**  
The **Thread Pool** in Node.js is a set of threads used by the **libuv** library to handle tasks that are CPU-intensive or involve blocking I/O operations, such as file system access, DNS lookups, and cryptography. Since Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop for asynchronous I/O, the thread pool allows offloading blocking tasks to worker threads without blocking the main event loop.

---

#### **2. How Does the Thread Pool Handle CPU-Intensive Tasks?**
**Answer:**  
The Thread Pool is primarily responsible for handling **CPU-bound tasks** that require intensive computation or blocking operations. These tasks are offloaded from the single-threaded event loop to the worker threads in the thread pool. This allows Node.js to continue processing I/O operations without being blocked by the CPU-intensive tasks. For example, operations like **file compression, encryption, or hashing** are executed in the thread pool to keep the event loop free.

**Example Scenario**:  
When reading a large file from disk, Node.js will delegate the disk read operation to a worker thread in the thread pool. Once the task is complete, the result is returned to the event loop for further processing.

---

#### **3. Explain libuv and Its Role in Node.js**
**Answer:**  
**libuv** is a cross-platform C library that provides **asynchronous I/O** and event-driven capabilities. It acts as the bridge between Node.js and the underlying OS, abstracting away platform-specific I/O details (e.g., event loops, file system operations, networking).

- **Role of libuv**:  
  - **Manages the event loop** for handling asynchronous operations.
  - **Handles non-blocking I/O** operations, like networking and file access.
  - Uses a **thread pool** to handle CPU-intensive tasks asynchronously without blocking the main event loop.

Libuv is the core component that makes Node.js highly scalable by offloading tasks to worker threads or other OS-level processes.

---

#### **4. How Many Threads Are in the Default Thread Pool?**
**Answer:**  
The default **thread pool** in Node.js is made up of **4 threads**. These threads are used for handling blocking I/O tasks, such as filesystem operations, DNS resolution, and cryptographic functions.

**Note:**  
This number can be adjusted based on the needs of the application.

---

#### **5. When Should You Increase Thread Pool Size?**
**Answer:**  
You should consider increasing the **thread pool size** when:
1. **CPU-bound tasks** are blocking the event loop for a long time, such as complex calculations, data processing, or encryption.
2. Your application performs **high-volume I/O operations** (e.g., file reading/writing) that need more concurrent worker threads.
3. **Performance monitoring** indicates that the default pool size (4 threads) is insufficient to handle the load, leading to tasks being queued and delayed.

**How to increase thread pool size**:  
The thread pool size can be modified by setting the `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` environment variable. For example, to set it to 8:

```bash
UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=8 node app.js
```

Increasing the pool size improves the ability to handle concurrent blocking tasks, but be cautious—having too many threads can lead to context-switching overhead.
